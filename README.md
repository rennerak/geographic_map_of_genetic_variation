# Chromosome 22: Creating a Geographic Map of Genetic Variation

This project is inspired by the study titled [Genes mirror geography within Europe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2735096/) by Novembre et al. and similarly aims to uncover the influence of ancestry on genotype and population data from chromosome 22 downloaded from the [The International Genome Sample Resource](https://www.internationalgenome.org/).

## Rationale:
Studies have demonstrated that genetic variants can differ significantly between populations, reflecting ancestral genetic differences. This correlation has implications for understanding disease susceptibility, treatment response, and population health disparities.

## Research Objective:
This project attempts to assess the correlation of genetic ancestry with genetic variation via:
- parsing data from human chromosome 22 and an associated population data panel
- running dimensionality reduction to assess correlation via geographic map
- dimensionality reduction will include PCA and tSNE
  
## Results:
